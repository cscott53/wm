	<p>Since 2021, <strong>Wafflemania</strong> has not only provided enticing breakfasts for on-the-go,
		drive-through, and dine-in, but we also provide brunch for special events like
	birthdays, Christmas, and other holidays.</p>
	<p>Most of our locations are in Charlotte, including our main location (shown in bottom of
	page), but we also have a few in Matthews, Pineville, and Gastonia.</p>
	<p>Meals are prepared on the spot, and served by our crew members at your service. We have an
	experienced cooking and catering group that can prepare almost any meal, and we also serve
	fountain drinks including Kool-aid and smoothies, with a wide variety of flavors.</p>
	<p>We also provide plates, silverware, and other items when needed, in case you want a spoon 	for your eggs, or a straw for your drink.</p>
